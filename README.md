# Drupal Payment Gateway plugins for Netgiro
Our OpenCart plugins use the iFrame and POST integration way described in [our Github documentation](https://netgiro.github.io/).

There are two different plugins available for Drupal:
- Standard Payment Gateway 
- Drupal Commerce ([download link](https://www.drupal.org/project/netgiro_payment/))

You can download specific .zip versions in [releases](https://github.com/netgiro/drupal-plugin/releases).

If the plugin version you need is not listed there, please contact us at netgiro@netgiro.is.
